A simple chat application that I built to improve my understanding of Web Sockets.

Visit the app at http://websockets-chat-application.herokuapp.com/, also have some of your friends open it 
and start chatting!

To run the app locally:
1. Clone the repository
2. Run npm install
3. Run npm start
4. Open multiple browser tabs/windows, visit http://localhost:3000/ in each of the tabs/windows and start chatting.
